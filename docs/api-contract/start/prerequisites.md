## Connected API
Read the section on [Creating an API instance](../../api/start/create.md) if you haven't done so already. The following examples assume you are connected to a compatible chain. 

For development purposes it's generally preferred to use a local development network, that way you can swap and purge contracts while developing. We recommend running the latest [Substrate Contracts Node](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node#download-binary) binary.
## Web3 accounts
You will need a Substrate account to sign messages. Check the [docs section on Keyring](../../api/start/keyring.md) in order to get access to dev accounts (Alice, Bob, Charlie, ..etc.) or create new ones. Alternatively, check out the [Extension package docs](../../extension/intro.md) in order to retrieve all injected accounts. 

## Contract build artifacts
The contract metadata and the wasm code are generated by building the contract with a tool like [cargo-contract](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract) or [solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang#build-for-substrate). These tools also generate a `<name>.contract` file which contains the metadata and includes the the wasm code under `metadata.source.wasm`. 

As metadata, all `api-contract` helpers accept either a JSON string, a parsed JSON or an `Abi` instance.


To understand everything fits together, [let's deploy a WASM contract and start using it](code.md).
