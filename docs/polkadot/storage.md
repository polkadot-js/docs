## auctions
 
### auctionCounter(): `u32`
- **interface**: `api.query.auctions.auctionCounter`
- **summary**:    Number of auctions started so far. 
 
### auctionInfo(): `Option<(u32,u32)>`
- **interface**: `api.query.auctions.auctionInfo`
- **summary**:    Information relating to the current auction, if there is one. 

   The first item in the tuple is the lease period index that the first of the four  contiguous lease periods on auction is for. The second is the block number when the  auction will "begin to end", i.e. the first block of the Ending Period of the auction. 
 
### reservedAmounts(`(AccountId32,u32)`): `Option<u128>`
- **interface**: `api.query.auctions.reservedAmounts`
- **summary**:    Amounts currently reserved in the accounts of the bidders currently winning  (sub-)ranges. 
 
### winning(`u32`): `Option<[Option<(AccountId32,u32,u128)>;36]>`
- **interface**: `api.query.auctions.winning`
- **summary**:    The winning bids for each of the 10 ranges at each sample in the final Ending Period of  the current auction. The map's key is the 0-based index into the Sample Size. The  first sample of the ending period is 0; the last is `Sample Size - 1`. 

___


## authorship
 
### author(): `Option<AccountId32>`
- **interface**: `api.query.authorship.author`
- **summary**:    Author of current block. 

___


## babe
 
### authorities(): `Vec<(SpConsensusBabeAppPublic,u64)>`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.authorities`
- **summary**:    Current epoch authorities. 
 
### authorVrfRandomness(): `Option<[u8;32]>`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.authorVrfRandomness`
- **summary**:    This field should always be populated during block processing unless  secondary plain slots are enabled (which don't contain a VRF output). 

   It is set in `on_finalize`, before it will contain the value from the last block. 
 
### currentSlot(): `u64`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.currentSlot`
- **summary**:    Current slot number. 
 
### epochConfig(): `Option<SpConsensusBabeBabeEpochConfiguration>`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.epochConfig`
- **summary**:    The configuration for the current epoch. Should never be `None` as it is initialized in  genesis. 
 
### epochIndex(): `u64`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.epochIndex`
- **summary**:    Current epoch index. 
 
### epochStart(): `(u32,u32)`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.epochStart`
- **summary**:    The block numbers when the last and current epoch have started, respectively `N-1` and  `N`.  NOTE: We track this is in order to annotate the block number when a given pool of  entropy was fixed (i.e. it was known to chain observers). Since epochs are defined in  slots, which may be skipped, the block numbers may not line up with the slot numbers. 
 
### genesisSlot(): `u64`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.genesisSlot`
- **summary**:    The slot at which the first epoch actually started. This is 0  until the first block of the chain. 
 
### initialized(): `Option<Option<SpConsensusBabeDigestsPreDigest>>`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.initialized`
- **summary**:    Temporary value (cleared at block finalization) which is `Some`  if per-block initialization has already been called for current block. 
 
### lateness(): `u32`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.lateness`
- **summary**:    How late the current block is compared to its parent. 

   This entry is populated as part of block execution and is cleaned up  on block finalization. Querying this storage entry outside of block  execution context should always yield zero. 
 
### nextAuthorities(): `Vec<(SpConsensusBabeAppPublic,u64)>`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.nextAuthorities`
- **summary**:    Next epoch authorities. 
 
### nextEpochConfig(): `Option<SpConsensusBabeBabeEpochConfiguration>`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.nextEpochConfig`
- **summary**:    The configuration for the next epoch, `None` if the config will not change  (you can fallback to `EpochConfig` instead in that case). 
 
### nextRandomness(): `[u8;32]`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.nextRandomness`
- **summary**:    Next epoch randomness. 
 
### pendingEpochConfigChange(): `Option<SpConsensusBabeDigestsNextConfigDescriptor>`

- **summary**:    Pending epoch configuration change that will be applied when the next epoch is enacted. 
 
### randomness(): `[u8;32]`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.randomness`
- **summary**:    The epoch randomness for the *current* epoch. 

   #### Security 

   This MUST NOT be used for gambling, as it can be influenced by a  malicious validator in the short term. It MAY be used in many  cryptographic protocols, however, so long as one remembers that this  (like everything else on-chain) it is public. For example, it can be  used where a number is needed that cannot have been chosen by an  adversary, for purposes such as public-coin zero-knowledge proofs. 
 
### segmentIndex(): `u32`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.segmentIndex`
- **summary**:    Randomness under construction. 

   We make a trade-off between storage accesses and list length.  We store the under-construction randomness in segments of up to  `UNDER_CONSTRUCTION_SEGMENT_LENGTH`. 

   Once a segment reaches this length, we begin the next one.  We reset all segments and return to `0` at the beginning of every  epoch. 
 
### skippedEpochs(): `Vec<(u64,u32)>`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.skippedEpochs`
- **summary**:    A list of the last 100 skipped epochs and the corresponding session index  when the epoch was skipped. 

   This is only used for validating equivocation proofs. An equivocation proof  must contains a key-ownership proof for a given session, therefore we need a  way to tie together sessions and epoch indices, i.e. we need to validate that  a validator was the owner of a given key on a given session, and what the  active epoch index was during that session. 
 
### underConstruction(`u32`): `Vec<[u8;32]>`
- **interface**: `api.query.babe.underConstruction`
- **summary**:    TWOX-NOTE: `SegmentIndex` is an increasing integer, so this is okay. 

___


## balances
 
### account(`AccountId32`): `PalletBalancesAccountData`
- **interface**: `api.query.balances.account`
- **summary**:    The Balances pallet example of storing the balance of an account. 

   #### Example 

   ```nocompile  impl pallet_balances::Config for Runtime {  type AccountStore = StorageMapShim<Self::Account<Runtime>, frame_system::Provider<Runtime>, AccountId, Self::AccountData<Balance>>  }  ``` 

   You can also store the balance of an account in the `System` pallet. 

   #### Example 

   ```nocompile  impl pallet_balances::Config for Runtime {  type AccountStore = System  }  ``` 

   But this comes with tradeoffs, storing account balances in the system pallet stores  `frame_system` data alongside the account data contrary to storing account balances in the  `Balances` pallet, which uses a `StorageMap` to store balances data only.  NOTE: This is only used in the case that this pallet is used to store balances. 
 
### freezes(`AccountId32`): `Vec<PalletBalancesIdAmount>`

### desiredTargets(): `Option<u32>`
- **interface**: `api.query.electionProviderMultiPhase.desiredTargets`
- **summary**:    Desired number of targets to elect for this round. 

   Only exists when [`Snapshot`] is present. 
 
### minimumUntrustedScore(): `Option<SpNposElectionsElectionScore>`
- **interface**: `api.query.electionProviderMultiPhase.minimumUntrustedScore`
- **summary**:    The minimum score that each 'untrusted' solution must attain in order to be considered  feasible.

### queuedSolution(): `Option<PalletElectionProviderMultiPhaseReadySolution>`
- **interface**: `api.query.electionProviderMultiPhase.queuedSolution`
- **summary**:    Current best solution, signed or unsigned, queued to be returned upon `elect`. 
 
### round(): `u32`
- **interface**: `api.query.electionProviderMultiPhase.round`
- **summary**:    Internal counter for the number of rounds. 

   This is useful for de-duplication of transactions submitted to the pool, and general  diagnostics of the pallet. 

   This is merely incremented once per every time that an upstream `elect` is called. 
 
### signedSubmissionIndices(): `Vec<(SpNposElectionsElectionScore,u32,u32)>`
- **interface**: `api.query.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedSubmissionIndices`
- **summary**:    A sorted, bounded vector of `(score, block_number, index)`, where each `index` points to a  value in `SignedSubmissions`. 

   We never need to process more than a single signed submission at a time. Signed submissions  can be quite large, so we're willing to pay the cost of multiple database accesses to access  them one at a time instead of reading and decoding all of them at once. 
 
### signedSubmissionNextIndex(): `u32`
- **interface**: `api.query.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedSubmissionNextIndex`
- **summary**:    The next index to be assigned to an incoming signed submission. 

   Every accepted submission is assigned a unique index; that index is bound to that particular  submission for the duration of the election. On election finalization, the next index is  reset to 0. 

   We can't just use `SignedSubmissionIndices.len()`, because that's a bounded set; past its  capacity, it will simply saturate. We can't just iterate over `SignedSubmissionsMap`,  because iteration is slow. Instead, we store the value here. 
 
### signedSubmissionsMap(`u32`): `Option<PalletElectionProviderMultiPhaseSignedSignedSubmission>`
- **interface**: `api.query.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedSubmissionsMap`
- **summary**:    Unchecked, signed solutions. 

   Together with `SubmissionIndices`, this stores a bounded set of `SignedSubmissions` while  allowing us to keep only a single one in memory at a time. 

   Twox note: the key of the map is an auto-incrementing index which users cannot inspect or  affect; we shouldn't need a cryptographically secure hasher. 
 
### snapshot(): `Option<PalletElectionProviderMultiPhaseRoundSnapshot>`
- **interface**: `api.query.electionProviderMultiPhase.snapshot`
- **summary**:    Snapshot data of the round. 

   This is created at the beginning of the signed phase and cleared upon calling `elect`. 
 
### snapshotMetadata(): `Option<PalletElectionProviderMultiPhaseSolutionOrSnapshotSize>`
- **interface**: `api.query.electionProviderMultiPhase.snapshotMetadata`
- **summary**:    The metadata of the [`RoundSnapshot`] 

   Only exists when [`Snapshot`] is present. 

___


## fastUnstake
 
### counterForQueue(): `u32`
- **interface**: `api.query.fastUnstake.counterForQueue`
- **summary**:    Counter for the related counted storage map 
 
### erasToCheckPerBlock(): `u32`
- **interface**: `api.query.fastUnstake.erasToCheckPerBlock`
- **summary**:    Number of eras to check per block. 

   If set to 0, this pallet does absolutely nothing. 

   Based on the amount of weight available at `on_idle`, up to this many eras of a single  nominator might be checked. 
 
### head(): `Option<PalletFastUnstakeUnstakeRequest>`
- **interface**: `api.query.fastUnstake.head`
- **summary**:    The current "head of the queue" being unstaked. 
 
### queue(`AccountId32`): `Option<u128>`
- **interface**: `api.query.fastUnstake.queue`
- **summary**:    The map of all accounts wishing to be unstaked. 

   Keeps track of `AccountId` wishing to unstake and it's corresponding deposit. 

   TWOX-NOTE: SAFE since `AccountId` is a secure hash. 

___


## grandpa
 
### currentSetId(): `u64`
- **interface**: `api.query.grandpa.currentSetId`
- **summary**:    The number of changes (both in terms of keys and underlying economic responsibilities)  in the "set" of Grandpa validators from genesis. 
 
### nextForced(): `Option<u32>`
- **interface**: `api.query.grandpa.nextForced`
- **summary**:    next block number where we can force a change. 
 
### pendingChange(): `Option<PalletGrandpaStoredPendingChange>`
- **interface**: `api.query.grandpa.pendingChange`
- **summary**:    Pending change: (signaled at, scheduled change). 
 
### setIdSession(`u64`): `Option<u32>`
- **interface**: `api.query.grandpa.setIdSession`
- **summary**:    A mapping from grandpa set ID to the index of the *most recent* session for which its  members were responsible. 

   This is only used for validating equivocation proofs. An equivocation proof must  contains a key-ownership proof for a given session, therefore we need a way to tie  together sessions and GRANDPA set ids, i.e. we need to validate that a validator  was the owner of a given key on a given session, and what the active set ID was  during that session. 

   TWOX-NOTE: `SetId` is not under user control. 
 
### stalled(): `Option<(u32,u32)>`
- **interface**: `api.query.grandpa.stalled`
- **summary**:    `true` if we are currently stalled. 
 
### state(): `PalletGrandpaStoredState`

### hrmpChannelContents(`PolkadotParachainPrimitivesHrmpChannelId`): `Vec<PolkadotCorePrimitivesInboundHrmpMessage>`
- **interface**: `api.query.hrmp.hrmpChannelContents`
- **summary**:    Storage for the messages for each channel.  Invariant: cannot be non-empty if the corresponding channel in `HrmpChannels` is `None`.

- **summary**:    The block number after which it's ok to send heartbeats in the current  session. 

   At the beginning of each session we set this to a value that should fall  roughly in the middle of the session duration. The idea is to first wait for  the validators to produce a block in the current session, so that the  heartbeat later on will not be necessary. 

   This value will only be used as a fallback if we fail to get a proper session  progress estimate from `NextSessionRotation`, as those estimates should be  more accurate then the value we calculate for `HeartbeatAfter`. 
 
### keys(): `Vec<PalletImOnlineSr25519AppSr25519Public>`

### hasInitialized(): `Option<Null>`
- **interface**: `api.query.initializer.hasInitialized`
- **summary**:    Whether the parachains modules have been initialized within this block. 

   Semantically a `bool`, but this guarantees it should never hit the trie,  as this is cleared in `on_finalize` and Frame optimizes `None` values to be empty values. 

   As a `bool`, `set(false)` and `remove()` both lead to the next `get()` being false, but one of  them writes to the trie and one does not. This confusion makes `Option<()>` more suitable for  the semantics of this variable. 

___

## paraInherent
 
### included(): `Option<Null>`
- **interface**: `api.query.paraInherent.included`
- **summary**:    Whether the paras inherent was included within this block. 

   The `Option<()>` is effectively a `bool`, but it never hits storage in the `None` variant  due to the guarantees of FRAME's storage APIs.

- **summary**:    This is used by the relay-chain to communicate to a parachain a go-ahead with in the upgrade procedure. 

   This value is absent when there are no upgrades scheduled or during the time the relay chain  performs the checks. It is set at the first relay-chain block when the corresponding parachain  can switch its upgrade function. As soon as the parachain's block is included, the value  gets reset to `None`.

   NOTE that this field is used by parachains via merkle storage proofs, therefore changing  the format will require migration of parachains. 

___


## paraScheduler
 
### availabilityCores(): `Vec<Option<PolkadotPrimitivesV4CoreOccupied>>`
- **interface**: `api.query.paraScheduler.availabilityCores`
- **summary**:    One entry for each availability core. Entries are `None` if the core is not currently occupied. Can be  temporarily `Some` if scheduled but not occupied.  The i'th parachain belongs to the i'th core, with the remaining cores all being  parathread-multiplexers. 

   Bounded by the maximum of either of these two values:

   Note that in the context of parachains modules the session change is signaled during  the block and enacted at the end of the block (at the finalization stage, to be exact).  Thus for all intents and purposes the effect of the session change is observed at the  block following the session change, block number of which we save in this storage value. 
 
### validatorGroups(): `Vec<Vec<u32>>`
- **interface**: `api.query.paraScheduler.validatorGroups`
- **summary**:    All the validator groups. One for each core. Indices are into `ActiveValidators` - not the  broader set of Polkadot validators, but instead just the subset used for parachains during  this session. 

   Bound: The number of cores is the sum of the numbers of parachains and parathread multiplexers.  Reasonably, 100-1000. The dominant factor is the number of validators: safe upper bound at 10k.

- **interface**: `api.query.staking.nominators`
- **summary**:    The map from nominator stash key to their nomination preferences, namely the validators that  they wish to support. 

   Note that the keys of this storage map might become non-decodable in case the  [`Config::MaxNominations`] configuration is decreased. In this rare case, these nominators  are still existent in storage, their key is correct and retrievable (i.e. `contains_key`  indicates that they exist), but their value cannot be decoded. Therefore, the non-decodable  nominators will effectively not-exist, until they re-submit their preferences such that it  is within the bounds of the newly set `Config::MaxNominations`. 

   This implies that `::iter_keys().count()` and `::iter().count()` might return different  values for this map. Moreover, the main `::count()` is aligned with the former, namely the  number of keys that exist. 

   Lastly, if any of the nominators become non-decodable, they can be chilled immediately via  [`Call::chill_other`] dispatchable by anyone. 

   TWOX-NOTE: SAFE since `AccountId` is a secure hash.

   This value should be a superset of disabled validators since not all offences lead to the  validator being disabled (if there was no slash). This is needed to track the percentage of  validators that have offended in the current era, ensuring a new era is forced if  `OffendingValidatorsThreshold` is reached. The vec is always kept sorted so that we can find  whether a given validator has previously offended using binary search. It gets cleared when  the era ends. 
 
### payee(`AccountId32`): `PalletStakingRewardDestination`

- **summary**:    Mapping between a topic (represented by T::Hash) and a vector of indexes  of events in the `<Events<T>>` list. 

   All topic vectors have deterministic storage locations depending on the topic. This  allows light-clients to leverage the changes trie storage tracking mechanism and  in case of changes fetch the list of events of interest. 

   The value has the type `(T::BlockNumber, EventIndex)` because if we used only just  the `EventIndex` then in case if the topic has the same contents on the next block  no notification will be triggered thus the event might be lost.

- **summary**:    Size of the dispatch queues. Caches sizes of the queues in `RelayDispatchQueue`. 

   First item in the tuple is the count of messages and second  is the total length (in bytes) of the message payloads. 

   Note that this is an auxiliary mapping: it's possible to tell the byte size and the number of  messages only looking at `RelayDispatchQueues`. This mapping is separate to avoid the cost of  loading the whole message queue if only the total size and count are required. 

   Invariant: 

  - The set of keys should exactly match the set of keys of `RelayDispatchQueues`.
