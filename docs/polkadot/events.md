## xcmPallet
 
### AssetsClaimed(`H256`, `XcmV3MultiLocation`, `XcmVersionedMultiAssets`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.AssetsClaimed.is`
- **summary**:    Some assets have been claimed from an asset trap 

   \[ hash, origin, assets \] 
 
### AssetsTrapped(`H256`, `XcmV3MultiLocation`, `XcmVersionedMultiAssets`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.AssetsTrapped.is`
- **summary**:    Some assets have been placed in an asset trap. 

   \[ hash, origin, assets \] 
 
### Attempted(`XcmV3TraitsOutcome`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.Attempted.is`
- **summary**:    Execution of an XCM message was attempted. 

   \[ outcome \] 
 
### FeesPaid(`XcmV3MultiLocation`, `XcmV3MultiassetMultiAssets`)

### InvalidQuerier(`XcmV3MultiLocation`, `u64`, `XcmV3MultiLocation`, `Option<XcmV3MultiLocation>`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.InvalidQuerier.is`
- **summary**:    Expected query response has been received but the querier location of the response does  not match the expected. The query remains registered for a later, valid, response to  be received and acted upon. 

   \[ origin location, id, expected querier, maybe actual querier \] 
 
### InvalidQuerierVersion(`XcmV3MultiLocation`, `u64`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.InvalidQuerierVersion.is`
- **summary**:    Expected query response has been received but the expected querier location placed in  storage by this runtime previously cannot be decoded. The query remains registered. 

   This is unexpected (since a location placed in storage in a previously executing  runtime should be readable prior to query timeout) and dangerous since the possibly  valid response will be dropped. Manual governance intervention is probably going to be  needed. 

   \[ origin location, id \] 
 
### InvalidResponder(`XcmV3MultiLocation`, `u64`, `Option<XcmV3MultiLocation>`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.InvalidResponder.is`
- **summary**:    Expected query response has been received but the origin location of the response does  not match that expected. The query remains registered for a later, valid, response to  be received and acted upon. 

   \[ origin location, id, expected location \] 
 
### InvalidResponderVersion(`XcmV3MultiLocation`, `u64`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.InvalidResponderVersion.is`
- **summary**:    Expected query response has been received but the expected origin location placed in  storage by this runtime previously cannot be decoded. The query remains registered. 

   This is unexpected (since a location placed in storage in a previously executing  runtime should be readable prior to query timeout) and dangerous since the possibly  valid response will be dropped. Manual governance intervention is probably going to be  needed. 

   \[ origin location, id \] 
 
### Notified(`u64`, `u8`, `u8`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.Notified.is`
- **summary**:    Query response has been received and query is removed. The registered notification has  been dispatched and executed successfully. 

   \[ id, pallet index, call index \] 
 
### NotifyDecodeFailed(`u64`, `u8`, `u8`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.NotifyDecodeFailed.is`
- **summary**:    Query response has been received and query is removed. The dispatch was unable to be  decoded into a `Call`; this might be due to dispatch function having a signature which  is not `(origin, QueryId, Response)`. 

   \[ id, pallet index, call index \] 
 
### NotifyDispatchError(`u64`, `u8`, `u8`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.NotifyDispatchError.is`
- **summary**:    Query response has been received and query is removed. There was a general error with  dispatching the notification call. 

   \[ id, pallet index, call index \] 
 
### NotifyOverweight(`u64`, `u8`, `u8`, `SpWeightsWeightV2Weight`, `SpWeightsWeightV2Weight`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.NotifyOverweight.is`
- **summary**:    Query response has been received and query is removed. The registered notification could  not be dispatched because the dispatch weight is greater than the maximum weight  originally budgeted by this runtime for the query result. 

   \[ id, pallet index, call index, actual weight, max budgeted weight \] 
 
### NotifyTargetMigrationFail(`XcmVersionedMultiLocation`, `u64`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.NotifyTargetMigrationFail.is`
- **summary**:    A given location which had a version change subscription was dropped owing to an error  migrating the location to our new XCM format. 

   \[ location, query ID \] 
 
### NotifyTargetSendFail(`XcmV3MultiLocation`, `u64`, `XcmV3TraitsError`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.NotifyTargetSendFail.is`
- **summary**:    A given location which had a version change subscription was dropped owing to an error  sending the notification to it. 

   \[ location, query ID, error \] 
 
### ResponseReady(`u64`, `XcmV3Response`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.ResponseReady.is`
- **summary**:    Query response has been received and is ready for taking with `take_response`. There is  no registered notification call. 

   \[ id, response \] 
 
### ResponseTaken(`u64`)

### UnexpectedResponse(`XcmV3MultiLocation`, `u64`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.UnexpectedResponse.is`
- **summary**:    Query response received which does not match a registered query. This may be because a  matching query was never registered, it may be because it is a duplicate response, or  because the query timed out. 

   \[ origin location, id \] 
 
### VersionChangeNotified(`XcmV3MultiLocation`, `u32`, `XcmV3MultiassetMultiAssets`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.VersionChangeNotified.is`
- **summary**:    An XCM version change notification message has been attempted to be sent. 

   The cost of sending it (borne by the chain) is included.
