The identity icon components allows you to display an address (or publicKey) as an unique icon, generated based on the contents and/or hash of the provided value. Additionally it allows for a variety of themes, either based on a Polkadot theme, Substrate theme or as a colored "Beachball". Additionally a custom renderer is also provided for, i.e. for cases where an app-specific icon is required.

Generation for all these are consistent and based on the underlying libraries are made available for a variety of platforms used for UI development: React, React Native and Vue. Doing this across platforms allows for consistency, the underlying generation is the same, however the display is optimized for the specific toolkit used.
