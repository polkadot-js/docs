The [@polkadot/ui-keyring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/ui-keyring) package provides a wrapper around the [@polkadot/keyring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/keyring) package, specifically for use in browser environments. The `ui-keyring` only extends the `keyring`, but does not replace it. All underlying account management functions are provided by the base keyring, the browser-specific extensions allows for transparent management of account state in storage.

Additionally where the base keyring is focussed on accounts, the `ui-keyring` extends this to cater for an address-book, contracts and allows for accounts to be tied to a specific chain. Since UIs are typically split into different parts, it also allows for subscriptions on accounts, so notifications are available when accounts are added or removed.
