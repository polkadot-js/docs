title: Installation
---

Yes, it really is as simple as [installing from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/keyring), so we are not going to waste too much time with the bare basics, just install the Keyring via

`yarn add @polkadot/keyring`

And it will be added and ready for use. The above will always install the latest stable release.


## Other dependencies

In most cases, you don't need to do anything else apart from just installing `@polkadot/keyring` above. It has dependencies such as `@polkadot/util` which are installed automatically alongside. When using `yarn` the dependencies are installed, flattened, available for use and you will never run into issues with mismatched versions.

If you are using the [API](../../api/intro.md) alongside the keyring, the keyring will be installed as a dependency of the API itself.

This means that by simply installing `@polkadot/api`, you will have access to utilities (crypto and normal) and keyring.


## Keyring basics

So we have it installed. Before we jump into actual real-world usage, [let's understand what the Keyring gives us](basics.md).
