- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.InvalidQuerier.is`
- **summary**:    Expected query response has been received but the querier location of the response does  not match the expected. The query remains registered for a later, valid, response to  be received and acted upon. 

   \[ origin location, id, expected querier, maybe actual querier \] 
 
### InvalidQuerierVersion(`XcmV3MultiLocation`, `u64`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.InvalidQuerierVersion.is`
- **summary**:    Expected query response has been received but the expected querier location placed in  storage by this runtime previously cannot be decoded. The query remains registered. 

   This is unexpected (since a location placed in storage in a previously executing  runtime should be readable prior to query timeout) and dangerous since the possibly  valid response will be dropped. Manual governance intervention is probably going to be  needed. 

   \[ origin location, id \]

### InvalidResponderVersion(`XcmV3MultiLocation`, `u64`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.InvalidResponderVersion.is`
- **summary**:    Expected query response has been received but the expected origin location placed in  storage by this runtime previously cannot be decoded. The query remains registered. 

   This is unexpected (since a location placed in storage in a previously executing  runtime should be readable prior to query timeout) and dangerous since the possibly  valid response will be dropped. Manual governance intervention is probably going to be  needed.

### NotifyDispatchError(`u64`, `u8`, `u8`)
- **interface**: `api.events.xcmPallet.NotifyDispatchError.is`
