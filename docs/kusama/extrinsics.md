## auctions
 
### bid(para: `Compact<u32>`, auction_index: `Compact<u32>`, first_slot: `Compact<u32>`, last_slot: `Compact<u32>`, amount: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.auctions.bid`
- **summary**:    Make a new bid from an account (including a parachain account) for deploying a new  parachain. 

   Multiple simultaneous bids from the same bidder are allowed only as long as all active  bids overlap each other (i.e. are mutually exclusive). Bids cannot be redacted. 

   - `sub` is the sub-bidder ID, allowing for multiple competing bids to be made by (and  funded by) the same account. 

  - `auction_index` is the index of the auction to bid on. Should just be the present value of `AuctionCounter`. 

  - `first_slot` is the first lease period index of the range to bid on. This is the absolute lease period index value, not an auction-specific offset. 

  - `last_slot` is the last lease period index of the range to bid on. This is the absolute lease period index value, not an auction-specific offset. 

  - `amount` is the amount to bid to be held as deposit for the parachain should the bid win. This amount is held throughout the range. 
 
### cancelAuction()
- **interface**: `api.tx.auctions.cancelAuction`

   Can only be called by Root origin. 
 
### newAuction(duration: `Compact<u32>`, lease_period_index: `Compact<u32>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.auctions.newAuction`
- **summary**:    Create a new auction. 

   This can only happen when there isn't already an auction in progress and may only be  called by the root origin. Accepts the `duration` of this auction and the  `lease_period_index` of the initial lease period of the four that are to be auctioned. 

___


## babe
 
### planConfigChange(config: `SpConsensusBabeDigestsNextConfigDescriptor`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.babe.planConfigChange`
- **summary**:    Plan an epoch config change. The epoch config change is recorded and will be enacted on  the next call to `enact_epoch_change`. The config will be activated one epoch after.  Multiple calls to this method will replace any existing planned config change that had  not been enacted yet. 
 
### reportEquivocation(equivocation_proof: `SpConsensusSlotsEquivocationProof`, key_owner_proof: `SpSessionMembershipProof`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.babe.reportEquivocation`

- **interface**: `api.tx.babe.reportEquivocationUnsigned`
- **summary**:    Report authority equivocation/misbehavior. This method will verify  the equivocation proof and validate the given key ownership proof  against the extracted offender. If both are valid, the offence will  be reported.  This extrinsic must be called unsigned and it is expected that only  block authors will call it (validated in `ValidateUnsigned`), as such  if the block author is defined it will be defined as the equivocation  reporter. 

___


## balances
 
### burn(value: `Compact<u128>`, keep_alive: `bool`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.burn`
- **summary**:    Burn the specified liquid free balance from the origin account. 

   If the origin's account ends up below the existential deposit as a result  of the burn and `keep_alive` is false, the account will be reaped. 

   Unlike sending funds to a _burn_ address, which merely makes the funds inaccessible,  this `burn` operation will reduce total issuance by the amount _burned_. 
 
### forceAdjustTotalIssuance(direction: `PalletBalancesAdjustmentDirection`, delta: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.forceAdjustTotalIssuance`
- **summary**:    Adjust the total issuance in a saturating way. 

   Can only be called by root and always needs a positive `delta`. 

   #### Example 
 
### forceSetBalance(who: `MultiAddress`, new_free: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.forceSetBalance`
- **summary**:    Set the regular balance of a given account.

- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.forceUnreserve`
- **summary**:    Unreserve some balance from a user by force. 

   Can only be called by ROOT. 
 
### transferAll(dest: `MultiAddress`, keep_alive: `bool`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.transferAll`
- **summary**:    Transfer the entire transferable balance from the caller account. 

   NOTE: This function only attempts to transfer _transferable_ balances. This means that  any locked, reserved, or existential deposits (when `keep_alive` is `true`), will not be  transferred by this function. To ensure that this function results in a killed account,  you might need to prepare the account by removing any reference counters, storage  deposits, etc... 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be Signed. 

   - `dest`: The recipient of the transfer. 

  - `keep_alive`: A boolean to determine if the `transfer_all` operation should send all of the funds the account has, causing the sender account to be killed (false), or  transfer everything except at least the existential deposit, which will guarantee to  keep the sender account alive (true). 
 
### transferAllowDeath(dest: `MultiAddress`, value: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.transferAllowDeath`
- **summary**:    Transfer some liquid free balance to another account. 

   `transfer_allow_death` will set the `FreeBalance` of the sender and receiver.  If the sender's account is below the existential deposit as a result  of the transfer, the account will be reaped. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be `Signed` by the transactor. 
 
### transferKeepAlive(dest: `MultiAddress`, value: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.transferKeepAlive`
- **summary**:    Same as the [`transfer_allow_death`] call, but with a check that the transfer will not  kill the origin account. 

   99% of the time you want [`transfer_allow_death`] instead. 

   [`transfer_allow_death`]: struct.Pallet.html#method.transfer 
 
### upgradeAccounts(who: `Vec<AccountId32>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.upgradeAccounts`
- **summary**:    Upgrade a specified account. 

   - `origin`: Must be `Signed`. 

  - `who`: The account to be upgraded.

   This will waive the transaction fee if at least all but 10% of the accounts needed to  be upgraded. (We let some not have to be upgraded just in order to allow for the  possibility of churn). 

___


## beefy
 
### reportEquivocation(equivocation_proof: `SpConsensusBeefyDoubleVotingProof`, key_owner_proof: `SpSessionMembershipProof`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.beefy.reportEquivocation`
- **summary**:    Report voter equivocation/misbehavior. This method will verify the  equivocation proof and validate the given key ownership proof  against the extracted offender. If both are valid, the offence  will be reported. 
 
### reportEquivocationUnsigned(equivocation_proof: `SpConsensusBeefyDoubleVotingProof`, key_owner_proof: `SpSessionMembershipProof`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.beefy.reportEquivocationUnsigned`
- **summary**:    Report voter equivocation/misbehavior. This method will verify the  equivocation proof and validate the given key ownership proof  against the extracted offender. If both are valid, the offence  will be reported. 

   This extrinsic must be called unsigned and it is expected that only  block authors will call it (validated in `ValidateUnsigned`), as such  if the block author is defined it will be defined as the equivocation  reporter. 
 
### setNewGenesis(delay_in_blocks: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.beefy.setNewGenesis`
- **summary**:    Reset BEEFY consensus by setting a new BEEFY genesis at `delay_in_blocks` blocks in the  future. 

   Note: `delay_in_blocks` has to be at least 1.

- **summary**:    Unassign curator from a bounty. 

   This function can only be called by the `RejectOrigin` a signed origin. 

   If this function is called by the `RejectOrigin`, we assume that the curator is  malicious or inactive. As a result, we will slash the curator when possible. 

   If the origin is the curator, we take this as a sign they are unable to do their job and  they willingly give up. We could slash them, but for now we allow them to recover their  deposit and exit without issue. (We may want to change this if it is abused.) 

   Finally, the origin can be anyone if and only if the curator is "inactive". This allows  anyone in the community to call out that a curator is not doing their due diligence, and  we should pick a new curator. In this case the curator should also be slashed.

   For the origin other than T::RejectOrigin and the child-bounty  curator, parent bounty must be in active state, for this call to  work. We allow child-bounty curator and T::RejectOrigin to execute  this call irrespective of the parent bounty state. 

   If this function is called by the `RejectOrigin` or the  parent bounty curator, we assume that the child-bounty curator is  malicious or inactive. As a result, child-bounty curator deposit is  slashed. 

   If the origin is the child-bounty curator, we take this as a sign  that they are unable to do their job, and are willingly giving up.  We could slash the deposit, but for now we allow them to unreserve  their deposit and exit without issue. (We may want to change this if  it is abused.) 

   Finally, the origin can be anyone iff the child-bounty curator is  "inactive". Expiry update due of parent bounty is used to estimate  inactive state of child-bounty curator. 

   This allows anyone in the community to call out that a child-bounty  curator is not doing their due diligence, and we should pick a new  one. In this case the child-bounty curator deposit is slashed. 

   State of child-bounty is moved to Added state on successful call  completion. 

   - `parent_bounty_id`: Index of parent bounty. 

  - `child_bounty_id`: Index of child bounty.

- **interface**: `api.tx.convictionVoting.delegate`
- **summary**:    Delegate the voting power (with some given conviction) of the sending account for a  particular class of polls. 

   The balance delegated is locked for as long as it's delegated, and thereafter for the  time appropriate for the conviction's lock period. 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be _Signed_, and the signing account must either: 

  - be delegating already; or

  - have no voting activity (if there is, then it will need to be removed through `remove_vote`). 

   - `to`: The account whose voting the `target` account's voting power will follow. 

  - `class`: The class of polls to delegate. To delegate multiple classes, multiple calls to this function are required. 

  - `conviction`: The conviction that will be attached to the delegated votes. When the account is undelegated, the funds will be locked for the corresponding period. 

  - `balance`: The amount of the account's balance to be used in delegating. This must not be more than the account's current balance. 

   Emits `Delegated`.

  - the poll has ended such that

  - the vote of the account was in opposition to the result; or

  - there was no conviction to the account's vote; or

  - the account made a split vote ...then the vote is removed cleanly and a following call to `unlock` may result in more  funds being available. 

   If, however, the poll has ended and: 

  - it finished corresponding to the vote of the account, and

  - the account made a standard vote with conviction, and

  - the lock period of the conviction is not over ...then the lock will be aggregated into the overall account's lock, which may involve 

  *overlocking* (where the two locks are combined into a single lock that is the maximum of both the amount locked and the time is it locked for). 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be _Signed_, and the signer must have a vote  registered for poll `index`. 

   - `index`: The index of poll of the vote to be removed. 

  - `class`: Optional parameter, if given it indicates the class of the poll. For polls which have finished or are cancelled, this must be `Some`. 

   Weight: `O(R + log R)` where R is the number of polls that `target` has voted on.  Weight is calculated for the maximum number of vote. 
 
### undelegate(class: `u16`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.convictionVoting.undelegate`

   This can only be set by `T::ForceOrigin`, and only when the phase is `Emergency`. 

   The solution is not checked for any feasibility and is assumed to be trustworthy, as any  feasibility check itself can in principle cause the election process to fail (due to  memory/weight constrains). 
 
### setMinimumUntrustedScore(maybe_next_score: `Option<SpNposElectionsElectionScore>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.electionProviderMultiPhase.setMinimumUntrustedScore`
- **summary**:    Set a new value for `MinimumUntrustedScore`.

- **interface**: `api.tx.electionProviderMultiPhase.submitUnsigned`
- **summary**:    Submit a solution for the unsigned phase. 

   The dispatch origin fo this call must be __none__. 

   This submission is checked on the fly. Moreover, this unsigned solution is only  validated when submitted to the pool from the **local** node. Effectively, this means  that only active validators can submit this transaction when authoring a block (similar  to an inherent). 

   To prevent any incorrect solution (and thus wasted time/weight), this transaction will  panic if the solution submitted by the validator is invalid in any way, effectively  putting their authoring reward at risk. 

   No deposit or reward is associated with this submission. 

___


## fastUnstake
 
### control(eras_to_check: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.fastUnstake.control`
- **summary**:    Control the operation of this pallet. 

   #### Dispatch Origin 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be [`Config::ControlOrigin`]. 

   #### Details 

   Can set the number of eras to check per block, and potentially other admin work. 

   #### Events 

   No events are emitted from this dispatch. 
 
### deregister()
- **interface**: `api.tx.fastUnstake.deregister`
- **summary**:    Deregister oneself from the fast-unstake. 

   #### Dispatch Origin 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be *signed* by whoever is permitted to call  unbond funds by the staking system. See [`Config::Staking`]. 

   #### Details 

   This is useful if one is registered, they are still waiting, and they change their mind. 

   Note that the associated stash is still fully unbonded and chilled as a consequence of  calling [`Pallet::register_fast_unstake`]. Therefore, this should probably be followed  by a call to `rebond` in the staking system. 

   #### Events 

   Some events from the staking and currency system might be emitted. 
 
### registerFastUnstake()
- **interface**: `api.tx.fastUnstake.registerFastUnstake`
- **summary**:    Register oneself for fast-unstake. 

   #### Dispatch Origin 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be *signed* by whoever is permitted to call  unbond funds by the staking system. See [`Config::Staking`]. 

   #### Details 

   The stash associated with the origin must have no ongoing unlocking chunks. If  successful, this will fully unbond and chill the stash. Then, it will enqueue the stash  to be checked in further blocks. 

   If by the time this is called, the stash is actually eligible for fast-unstake, then  they are guaranteed to remain eligible, because the call will chill them as well. 

   If the check works, the entire staking data is removed, i.e. the stash is fully  unstaked. 

   If the check fails, the stash remains chilled and waiting for being unbonded as in with  the normal staking system, but they lose part of their unbonding chunks due to consuming  the chain's resources. 

   #### Events 

   Some events from the staking and currency system might be emitted.

- **summary**:    A bonded member can use this to claim their payout based on the rewards that the pool  has accumulated since their last claimed payout (OR since joining if this is their first  time claiming rewards). The payout will be transferred to the member's account. 

   The member will earn rewards pro rata based on the members stake vs the sum of the  members in the pools stake. Rewards do not "expire". 

   See `claim_payout_other` to claim rewards on behalf of some `other` pool member. 
 
### claimPayoutOther(other: `AccountId32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.claimPayoutOther`
- **summary**:    `origin` can claim payouts on some pool member `other`'s behalf. 

   Pool member `other` must have a `PermissionlessWithdraw` or `PermissionlessAll` claim  permission for this call to be successful. 
 
### create(amount: `Compact<u128>`, root: `MultiAddress`, nominator: `MultiAddress`, bouncer: `MultiAddress`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.create`
- **summary**:    Create a new delegation pool. 

   #### Arguments 

   * `amount` - The amount of funds to delegate to the pool. This also acts of a sort of  deposit since the pools creator cannot fully unbond funds until the pool is being  destroyed. 

  * `index` - A disambiguation index for creating the account. Likely only useful when creating multiple pools in the same extrinsic. 

  * `root` - The account to set as [`PoolRoles::root`].

  * `nominator` - The account to set as the [`PoolRoles::nominator`].

  * `bouncer` - The account to set as the [`PoolRoles::bouncer`].

   #### Note 

   In addition to `amount`, the caller will transfer the existential deposit; so the caller  needs at have at least `amount + existential_deposit` transferable. 
 
### createWithPoolId(amount: `Compact<u128>`, root: `MultiAddress`, nominator: `MultiAddress`, bouncer: `MultiAddress`, pool_id: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.createWithPoolId`
- **summary**:    Create a new delegation pool with a previously used pool id 

   #### Arguments 

   same as `create` with the inclusion of 

  * `pool_id` - `A valid PoolId.
 
### join(amount: `Compact<u128>`, pool_id: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.join`
- **summary**:    Stake funds with a pool. The amount to bond is transferred from the member to the  pools account and immediately increases the pools bond. 

   #### Note 

   * An account can only be a member of a single pool. 

  * An account cannot join the same pool multiple times.

  * This call will *not* dust the member account, so the member must have at least `existential deposit + amount` in their account. 

  * Only a pool with [`PoolState::Open`] can be joined
 
### migrateDelegation(member_account: `MultiAddress`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.migrateDelegation`
- **summary**:    Migrates delegated funds from the pool account to the `member_account`. 

   Fails unless [`crate::pallet::Config::StakeAdapter`] is of strategy type:  [`adapter::StakeStrategyType::Delegate`]. 

   This is a permission-less call and refunds any fee if claim is successful. 

   If the pool has migrated to delegation based staking, the staked tokens of pool members  can be moved and held in their own account. See [`adapter::DelegateStake`] 
 
### migratePoolToDelegateStake(pool_id: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.migratePoolToDelegateStake`
- **summary**:    Migrate pool from [`adapter::StakeStrategyType::Transfer`] to  [`adapter::StakeStrategyType::Delegate`]. 

   Fails unless [`crate::pallet::Config::StakeAdapter`] is of strategy type:  [`adapter::StakeStrategyType::Delegate`]. 

   This call can be dispatched permissionlessly, and refunds any fee if successful. 

   If the pool has already migrated to delegation based staking, this call will fail. 
 
### nominate(pool_id: `u32`, validators: `Vec<AccountId32>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.nominate`
- **summary**:    Nominate on behalf of the pool. 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be signed by the pool nominator or the pool  root role. 

   This directly forward the call to the staking pallet, on behalf of the pool bonded  account. 

   #### Note 

   In addition to a `root` or `nominator` role of `origin`, pool's depositor needs to have  at least `depositor_min_bond` in the pool to start nominating. 
 
### poolWithdrawUnbonded(pool_id: `u32`, num_slashing_spans: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.poolWithdrawUnbonded`
- **summary**:    Call `withdraw_unbonded` for the pools account. This call can be made by any account. 

   This is useful if there are too many unlocking chunks to call `unbond`, and some  can be cleared by withdrawing. In the case there are too many unlocking chunks, the user  would probably see an error like `NoMoreChunks` emitted from the staking system when  they attempt to unbond. 
 
### setClaimPermission(permission: `PalletNominationPoolsClaimPermission`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setClaimPermission`
- **summary**:    Allows a pool member to set a claim permission to allow or disallow permissionless  bonding and withdrawing.

  * `permission` - The permission to be applied.
 
### setCommission(pool_id: `u32`, new_commission: `Option<(Perbill,AccountId32)>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setCommission`
- **summary**:    Set the commission of a pool.  Both a commission percentage and a commission payee must be provided in the `current`  tuple. Where a `current` of `None` is provided, any current commission will be removed. 

   - If a `None` is supplied to `new_commission`, existing commission will be removed. 
 
### setCommissionChangeRate(pool_id: `u32`, change_rate: `PalletNominationPoolsCommissionChangeRate`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setCommissionChangeRate`
- **summary**:    Set the commission change rate for a pool. 

   Initial change rate is not bounded, whereas subsequent updates can only be more  restrictive than the current. 
 
### setCommissionClaimPermission(pool_id: `u32`, permission: `Option<PalletNominationPoolsCommissionClaimPermission>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setCommissionClaimPermission`
- **summary**:    Set or remove a pool's commission claim permission. 

   Determines who can claim the pool's pending commission. Only the `Root` role of the pool  is able to configure commission claim permissions. 
 
### setCommissionMax(pool_id: `u32`, max_commission: `Perbill`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setCommissionMax`
- **summary**:    Set the maximum commission of a pool. 

   - Initial max can be set to any `Perbill`, and only smaller values thereafter. 

  - Current commission will be lowered in the event it is higher than a new max commission. 
 
### setConfigs(min_join_bond: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpU128`, min_create_bond: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpU128`, max_pools: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpU32`, max_members: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpU32`, max_members_per_pool: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpU32`, global_max_commission: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpPerbill`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setConfigs`
- **summary**:    Update configurations for the nomination pools. The origin for this call must be  [`Config::AdminOrigin`]. 

   #### Arguments 

   * `min_join_bond` - Set [`MinJoinBond`].

  * `max_members_per_pool` - Set [`MaxPoolMembersPerPool`].

  * `global_max_commission` - Set [`GlobalMaxCommission`].
 
### setMetadata(pool_id: `u32`, metadata: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setMetadata`
- **summary**:    Set a new metadata for the pool. 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be signed by the bouncer, or the root role of the  pool. 
 
### setState(pool_id: `u32`, state: `PalletNominationPoolsPoolState`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setState`
- **summary**:    Set a new state for the pool. 

   If a pool is already in the `Destroying` state, then under no condition can its state  change again. 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be either: 

   1. signed by the bouncer, or the root role of the pool,  2. if the pool conditions to be open are NOT met (as described by `ok_to_be_open`), and  then the state of the pool can be permissionlessly changed to `Destroying`. 
 
### unbond(member_account: `MultiAddress`, unbonding_points: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.unbond`
- **summary**:    Unbond up to `unbonding_points` of the `member_account`'s funds from the pool. It  implicitly collects the rewards one last time, since not doing so would mean some  rewards would be forfeited. 

   Under certain conditions, this call can be dispatched permissionlessly (i.e. by any  account). 

   #### Conditions for a permissionless dispatch. 

   * The pool is blocked and the caller is either the root or bouncer. This is refereed to  as a kick. 

  * The pool is destroying and the member is not the depositor.

  * The pool is destroying, the member is the depositor and no other members are in the pool. 

   #### Conditions for permissioned dispatch (i.e. the caller is also the  `member_account`): 

   * The caller is not the depositor. 

  * The caller is the depositor, the pool is destroying and no other members are in the pool. 

   #### Note 

   If there are too many unlocking chunks to unbond with the pool account,  [`Call::pool_withdraw_unbonded`] can be called to try and minimize unlocking chunks.  The [`StakingInterface::unbond`] will implicitly call [`Call::pool_withdraw_unbonded`]  to try to free chunks if necessary (ie. if unbound was called and no unlocking chunks  are available). However, it may not be possible to release the current unlocking chunks,  in which case, the result of this call will likely be the `NoMoreChunks` error from the  staking system. 
 
### updateRoles(pool_id: `u32`, new_root: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpAccountId32`, new_nominator: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpAccountId32`, new_bouncer: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpAccountId32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.updateRoles`
- **summary**:    Update the roles of the pool. 

   The root is the only entity that can change any of the roles, including itself,  excluding the depositor, who can never change. 

   It emits an event, notifying UIs of the role change. This event is quite relevant to  most pool members and they should be informed of changes to pool roles. 
 
### withdrawUnbonded(member_account: `MultiAddress`, num_slashing_spans: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.withdrawUnbonded`
- **summary**:    Withdraw unbonded funds from `member_account`. If no bonded funds can be unbonded, an  error is returned. 

   Under certain conditions, this call can be dispatched permissionlessly (i.e. by any  account). 

   #### Conditions for a permissionless dispatch 

   * The pool is in destroy mode and the target is not the depositor. 

  * The target is the depositor and they are the only member in the sub pools.

  * The pool is blocked and the caller is either the root or bouncer.

   #### Conditions for permissioned dispatch 

   * The caller is the target and they are not the depositor. 

   #### Note 

   - If the target is the depositor, the pool will be destroyed. 

  - If the pool has any pending slash, we also try to slash the member before letting them withdraw. This calculation adds some weight overhead and is only defensive. In reality,  pool slashes must have been already applied via permissionless [`Call::apply_slash`].

## paras
 
### addTrustedValidationCode(validation_code: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.paras.addTrustedValidationCode`
- **summary**:    Adds the validation code to the storage. 

   The code will not be added if it is already present. Additionally, if PVF pre-checking  is running for that code, it will be instantly accepted. 

   Otherwise, the code will be added into the storage. Note that the code will be added  into storage with reference count 0. This is to account the fact that there are no users  for this code yet. The caller will have to make sure that this code eventually gets  used by some parachain or removed from the storage to avoid storage leaks. For the  latter prefer to use the `poke_unused_validation_code` dispatchable to raw storage  manipulation. 

   This function is mainly meant to be used for upgrading parachains that do not follow  the go-ahead signal while the PVF pre-checking feature is enabled. 
 
### forceNoteNewHead(para: `u32`, new_head: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.paras.forceNoteNewHead`

- **summary**:    Set the storage for the current parachain head data immediately. 
 
### forceSetMostRecentContext(para: `u32`, context: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.paras.forceSetMostRecentContext`
- **summary**:    Set the storage for the current parachain head data immediately. 
 
### includePvfCheckStatement(stmt: `PolkadotPrimitivesV7PvfCheckStatement`, signature: `PolkadotPrimitivesV7ValidatorAppSignature`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.paras.includePvfCheckStatement`
- **summary**:    Includes a statement for a PVF pre-checking vote. Potentially, finalizes the vote and  enacts the results if that was the last vote before achieving the supermajority. 
 
### pokeUnusedValidationCode(validation_code_hash: `H256`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.paras.pokeUnusedValidationCode`
- **summary**:    Remove the validation code from the storage iff the reference count is 0. 

   This is better than removing the storage directly, because it will not remove the code  that was suddenly got used by some parachain while this dispatchable was pending  dispatching.

   Can be called by Root, the parachain, or the parachain manager if the parachain is  unlocked. 
 
### deregister(id: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.deregister`
- **summary**:    Deregister a Para Id, freeing all data and returning any deposit. 

   The caller must be Root, the `para` owner, or the `para` itself. The para must be an  on-demand parachain. 
 
### forceRegister(who: `AccountId32`, deposit: `u128`, id: `u32`, genesis_head: `Bytes`, validation_code: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.forceRegister`
- **summary**:    Force the registration of a Para Id on the relay chain. 

   This function must be called by a Root origin. 

   The deposit taken can be specified for this registration. Any `ParaId`  can be registered, including sub-1000 IDs which are System Parachains. 
 
### register(id: `u32`, genesis_head: `Bytes`, validation_code: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.register`
- **summary**:    Register head data and validation code for a reserved Para Id. 

   #### Arguments 

  - `origin`: Must be called by a `Signed` origin.

  - `id`: The para ID. Must be owned/managed by the `origin` signing account.

  - `genesis_head`: The genesis head data of the parachain/thread.

  - `validation_code`: The initial validation code of the parachain/thread.

   #### Deposits/Fees  The account with the originating signature must reserve a deposit. 

   The deposit is required to cover the costs associated with storing the genesis head  data and the validation code.  This accounts for the potential to store validation code of a size up to the  `max_code_size`, as defined in the configuration pallet 

   Anything already reserved previously for this para ID is accounted for. 

   #### Events  The `Registered` event is emitted in case of success. 
 
### removeLock(para: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.removeLock`
- **summary**:    Remove a manager lock from a para. This will allow the manager of a  previously locked para to deregister or swap a para without using governance. 

   Can only be called by the Root origin or the parachain. 
 
### reserve()
- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.reserve`
- **summary**:    Reserve a Para Id on the relay chain. 

   This function will reserve a new Para Id to be owned/managed by the origin account.  The origin account is able to register head data and validation code using `register` to  create an on-demand parachain. Using the Slots pallet, an on-demand parachain can then  be upgraded to a lease holding parachain. 

   #### Arguments 

  - `origin`: Must be called by a `Signed` origin. Becomes the manager/owner of the new para ID. 

   #### Deposits/Fees  The origin must reserve a deposit of `ParaDeposit` for the registration. 

   #### Events  The `Reserved` event is emitted in case of success, which provides the ID reserved for  use. 
 
### scheduleCodeUpgrade(para: `u32`, new_code: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.scheduleCodeUpgrade`
- **summary**:    Schedule a parachain upgrade. 

   This will kick off a check of `new_code` by all validators. After the majority of the  validators have reported on the validity of the code, the code will either be enacted  or the upgrade will be rejected. If the code will be enacted, the current code of the  parachain will be overwritten directly. This means that any PoV will be checked by this  new code. The parachain itself will not be informed explicitly that the validation code  has changed. 

   Can be called by Root, the parachain, or the parachain manager if the parachain is  unlocked. 
 
### setCurrentHead(para: `u32`, new_head: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.setCurrentHead`
- **summary**:    Set the parachain's current head. 

   Can be called by Root, the parachain, or the parachain manager if the parachain is  unlocked. 
 
### swap(id: `u32`, other: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.swap`
- **summary**:    Swap a lease holding parachain with another parachain, either on-demand or lease  holding. 

   The origin must be Root, the `para` owner, or the `para` itself. 

   The swap will happen only if there is already an opposite swap pending. If there is not,  the swap will be stored in the pending swaps map, ready for a later confirmatory swap. 

   The `ParaId`s remain mapped to the same head data and code so external code can rely on  `ParaId` to be a long-term identifier of a notional "parachain". However, their  scheduling info (i.e. whether they're an on-demand parachain or lease holding  parachain), auction information and the auction deposit are switched.

   Effects will be felt at the beginning of the next era. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_, but can be called by anyone. 

   If the caller is the same as the controller being targeted, then no further checks are  enforced, and this function behaves just like `chill`. 

   If the caller is different than the controller being targeted, the following conditions  must be met: 

   * `controller` must belong to a nominator who has become non-decodable, 

   Or: 

   * A `ChillThreshold` must be set and checked which defines how close to the max  nominators or validators we must reach before users can start chilling one-another. 

  * A `MaxNominatorCount` and `MaxValidatorCount` must be set which is used to determine how close we are to the threshold. 

  * A `MinNominatorBond` and `MinValidatorBond` must be set and checked, which determines if this is a person that should be chilled because they have not met the threshold  bond required. 

   This can be helpful if bond requirements are updated, and we need to remove old users  who do not satisfy these requirements. 
 
### deprecateControllerBatch(controllers: `Vec<AccountId32>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.deprecateControllerBatch`
- **summary**:    Updates a batch of controller accounts to their corresponding stash account if they are  not the same. Ignores any controller accounts that do not exist, and does not operate if  the stash and controller are already the same. 

   Effects will be felt instantly (as soon as this function is completed successfully). 

   The dispatch origin must be `T::AdminOrigin`. 
 
### forceApplyMinCommission(validator_stash: `AccountId32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.forceApplyMinCommission`
- **summary**:    Force a validator to have at least the minimum commission. This will not affect a  validator who already has a commission greater than or equal to the minimum. Any account  can call this. 
 
### forceNewEra()
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.forceNewEra`
- **summary**:    Force there to be a new era at the end of the next session. After this, it will be  reset to normal (non-forced) behaviour. 

   The dispatch origin must be Root. 

   #### Warning 

   The election process starts multiple blocks before the end of the era.  If this is called just before a new era is triggered, the election process may not  have enough blocks to get a result. 

   #### Complexity 

  - No arguments.

  - Weight: O(1)
 
### forceNewEraAlways()
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.forceNewEraAlways`
- **summary**:    Force there to be a new era at the end of sessions indefinitely. 

   The dispatch origin must be Root. 

   #### Warning 

   The election process starts multiple blocks before the end of the era.  If this is called just before a new era is triggered, the election process may not  have enough blocks to get a result. 
 
### forceNoEras()
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.forceNoEras`
- **summary**:    Force there to be no new eras indefinitely. 

   The dispatch origin must be Root. 

   #### Warning 

   The election process starts multiple blocks before the end of the era.  Thus the election process may be ongoing when this is called. In this case the  election will continue until the next era is triggered. 

   #### Complexity 

  - No arguments.

  - Weight: O(1)
 
### forceUnstake(stash: `AccountId32`, num_slashing_spans: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.forceUnstake`
- **summary**:    Force a current staker to become completely unstaked, immediately. 

   The dispatch origin must be Root.

### kick(who: `Vec<MultiAddress>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.kick`
- **summary**:    Remove the given nominations from the calling validator. 

   Effects will be felt at the beginning of the next era. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash. 

   - `who`: A list of nominator stash accounts who are nominating this validator which  should no longer be nominating this validator. 

   Note: Making this call only makes sense if you first set the validator preferences to  block any further nominations. 
 
### nominate(targets: `Vec<MultiAddress>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.nominate`
- **summary**:    Declare the desire to nominate `targets` for the origin controller. 

   Effects will be felt at the beginning of the next era. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash. 

   #### Complexity 

  - The transaction's complexity is proportional to the size of `targets` (N) which is capped at CompactAssignments::LIMIT (T::MaxNominations). 

  - Both the reads and writes follow a similar pattern.
 
### payoutStakers(validator_stash: `AccountId32`, era: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.payoutStakers`
- **summary**:    Pay out next page of the stakers behind a validator for the given era. 

   - `validator_stash` is the stash account of the validator. 

  - `era` may be any era between `[current_era - history_depth; current_era]`.

   The origin of this call must be _Signed_. Any account can call this function, even if  it is not one of the stakers. 

   The reward payout could be paged in case there are too many nominators backing the  `validator_stash`. This call will payout unpaid pages in an ascending order. To claim a  specific page, use `payout_stakers_by_page`.` 

   If all pages are claimed, it returns an error `InvalidPage`. 
 
### payoutStakersByPage(validator_stash: `AccountId32`, era: `u32`, page: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.payoutStakersByPage`
- **summary**:    Pay out a page of the stakers behind a validator for the given era and page. 

   - `validator_stash` is the stash account of the validator. 

  - `era` may be any era between `[current_era - history_depth; current_era]`.

  - `page` is the page index of nominators to pay out with value between 0 and `num_nominators / T::MaxExposurePageSize`. 

   The origin of this call must be _Signed_. Any account can call this function, even if  it is not one of the stakers. 

   If a validator has more than [`Config::MaxExposurePageSize`] nominators backing  them, then the list of nominators is paged, with each page being capped at  [`Config::MaxExposurePageSize`.] If a validator has more than one page of nominators,  the call needs to be made for each page separately in order for all the nominators  backing a validator to receive the reward. The nominators are not sorted across pages  and so it should not be assumed the highest staker would be on the topmost page and vice  versa. If rewards are not claimed in [`Config::HistoryDepth`] eras, they are lost. 
 
### reapStash(stash: `AccountId32`, num_slashing_spans: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.reapStash`
- **summary**:    Remove all data structures concerning a staker/stash once it is at a state where it can  be considered `dust` in the staking system. The requirements are: 

   1. the `total_balance` of the stash is below existential deposit.  2. or, the `ledger.total` of the stash is below existential deposit.  3. or, existential deposit is zero and either `total_balance` or `ledger.total` is zero. 

   The former can happen in cases like a slash; the latter when a fully unbonded account  is still receiving staking rewards in `RewardDestination::Staked`. 

   It can be called by anyone, as long as `stash` meets the above requirements. 

   Refunds the transaction fees upon successful execution. 

   #### Parameters 

   - `num_slashing_spans`: Refer to comments on [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`] for more  details. 
 
### rebond(value: `Compact<u128>`)

- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.restoreLedger`
- **summary**:    Restores the state of a ledger which is in an inconsistent state. 

   The requirements to restore a ledger are the following: 

  * The stash is bonded; or

  * The stash is not bonded but it has a staking lock left behind; or

  * If the stash has an associated ledger and its state is inconsistent; or

  * If the ledger is not corrupted *but* its staking lock is out of sync.

   The `maybe_*` input parameters will overwrite the corresponding data and metadata of the  ledger associated with the stash. If the input parameters are not set, the ledger will  be reset values from on-chain state. 
 
### scaleValidatorCount(factor: `Percent`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.scaleValidatorCount`
- **summary**:    Scale up the ideal number of validators by a factor up to maximum of  `ElectionProviderBase::MaxWinners`.

### setController()
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.setController`
- **summary**:    (Re-)sets the controller of a stash to the stash itself. This function previously  accepted a `controller` argument to set the controller to an account other than the  stash itself. This functionality has now been removed, now only setting the controller  to the stash, if it is not already. 

   Effects will be felt instantly (as soon as this function is completed successfully). 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the stash, not the controller. 

   #### Complexity  O(1)

- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.setMinCommission`
- **summary**:    Sets the minimum amount of commission that each validators must maintain. 

   This call has lower privilege requirements than `set_staking_config` and can be called  by the `T::AdminOrigin`. Root can always call this. 
 
### setPayee(payee: `PalletStakingRewardDestination`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.setPayee`
- **summary**:    (Re-)set the payment target for a controller. 

   Effects will be felt instantly (as soon as this function is completed successfully). 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash. 

   #### Complexity 

  - O(1)

  - Independent of the arguments. Insignificant complexity.

  - Contains a limited number of reads.

  - Writes are limited to the `origin` account key.

### setStakingConfigs(min_nominator_bond: `PalletStakingPalletConfigOpU128`, min_validator_bond: `PalletStakingPalletConfigOpU128`, max_nominator_count: `PalletStakingPalletConfigOpU32`, max_validator_count: `PalletStakingPalletConfigOpU32`, chill_threshold: `PalletStakingPalletConfigOpPercent`, min_commission: `PalletStakingPalletConfigOpPerbill`, max_staked_rewards: `PalletStakingPalletConfigOpPercent`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.setStakingConfigs`
- **summary**:    Update the various staking configurations . 

   * `min_nominator_bond`: The minimum active bond needed to be a nominator. 

  * `min_validator_bond`: The minimum active bond needed to be a validator.

  * `max_nominator_count`: The max number of users who can be a nominator at once. When set to `None`, no limit is enforced. 

  * `max_validator_count`: The max number of users who can be a validator at once. When set to `None`, no limit is enforced. 

  * `chill_threshold`: The ratio of `max_nominator_count` or `max_validator_count` which should be filled in order for the `chill_other` transaction to work. 

  * `min_commission`: The minimum amount of commission that each validators must maintain. This is checked only upon calling `validate`. Existing validators are not affected. 

   RuntimeOrigin must be Root to call this function. 

   NOTE: Existing nominators and validators will not be affected by this update.  to kick people under the new limits, `chill_other` should be called. 
 
### setValidatorCount(new: `Compact<u32>`)

### unbond(value: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.unbond`
- **summary**:    Schedule a portion of the stash to be unlocked ready for transfer out after the bond  period ends. If this leaves an amount actively bonded less than  T::Currency::minimum_balance(), then it is increased to the full amount. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash. 

   Once the unlock period is done, you can call `withdraw_unbonded` to actually move  the funds out of management ready for transfer. 

   No more than a limited number of unlocking chunks (see `MaxUnlockingChunks`)  can co-exists at the same time. If there are no unlocking chunks slots available  [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`] is called to remove some of the chunks (if possible). 

   If a user encounters the `InsufficientBond` error when calling this extrinsic,  they should call `chill` first in order to free up their bonded funds. 

   Emits `Unbonded`. 

   See also [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`]. 
 
### updatePayee(controller: `AccountId32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.updatePayee`
- **summary**:    Migrates an account's `RewardDestination::Controller` to  `RewardDestination::Account(controller)`.

   This will waive the transaction fee if the `payee` is successfully migrated. 
 
### validate(prefs: `PalletStakingValidatorPrefs`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.validate`
- **summary**:    Declare the desire to validate for the origin controller. 

   Effects will be felt at the beginning of the next era. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash. 
 
### withdrawUnbonded(num_slashing_spans: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.withdrawUnbonded`
- **summary**:    Remove any unlocked chunks from the `unlocking` queue from our management. 

   This essentially frees up that balance to be used by the stash account to do whatever  it wants. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller. 

   Emits `Withdrawn`. 

   See also [`Call::unbond`]. 

   #### Parameters

In this case, the `num_slashing_spans` must be larger or equal to the number of  slashing spans associated with the stash account in the [`SlashingSpans`] storage type,  otherwise the call will fail. The call weight is directly proportional to  `num_slashing_spans`. 

   #### Complexity  O(S) where S is the number of slashing spans to remove  NOTE: Weight annotation is the kill scenario, we refund otherwise.

   #### Complexity 

  - O(C) where C is the number of calls to be batched.

   This will return `Ok` in all circumstances. To determine the success of the batch, an  event is deposited. If a call failed and the batch was interrupted, then the  `BatchInterrupted` event is deposited, along with the number of successful calls made  and the error of the failed call. If all were successful, then the `BatchCompleted`  event is deposited. 
 
### batchAll(calls: `Vec<Call>`)

If both schedules have already started the  current block will be used as the schedule start; with the caveat that if one schedule  is finished by the current block, the other will be treated as the new merged schedule,  unmodified. 

   NOTE: If `schedule1_index == schedule2_index` this is a no-op.  NOTE: This will unlock all schedules through the current block prior to merging.  NOTE: If both schedules have ended by the current block, no new schedule will be created  and both will be removed. 

   Merged schedule attributes: 

  - `starting_block`: `MAX(schedule1.starting_block, scheduled2.starting_block, current_block)`. 

  - `ending_block`: `MAX(schedule1.ending_block, schedule2.ending_block)`.

  - `locked`: `schedule1.locked_at(current_block) + schedule2.locked_at(current_block)`.

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_. 

   - `schedule1_index`: index of the first schedule to merge. 

  - `schedule2_index`: index of the second schedule to merge.

   **This function is deprecated: Use `limited_reserve_transfer_assets` instead.** 

   Fee payment on the destination side is made from the asset in the `assets` vector of  index `fee_asset_item`. The weight limit for fees is not provided and thus is unlimited,  with all fees taken as needed from the asset. 

   - `origin`: Must be capable of withdrawing the `assets` and executing XCM.

- **interface**: `api.tx.xcmPallet.teleportAssets`
- **summary**:    Teleport some assets from the local chain to some destination chain. 

   **This function is deprecated: Use `limited_teleport_assets` instead.** 

   Fee payment on the destination side is made from the asset in the `assets` vector of  index `fee_asset_item`. The weight limit for fees is not provided and thus is unlimited,  with all fees taken as needed from the asset. 

   - `origin`: Must be capable of withdrawing the `assets` and executing XCM.

- **interface**: `api.tx.xcmPallet.transferAssets`
- **summary**:    Transfer some assets from the local chain to the destination chain through their local,  destination or remote reserve, or through teleports. 

   Fee payment on the destination side is made from the asset in the `assets` vector of  index `fee_asset_item` (hence referred to as `fees`), up to enough to pay for  `weight_limit` of weight. If more weight is needed than `weight_limit`, then the  operation will fail and the sent assets may be at risk. 

   `assets` (excluding `fees`) must have same reserve location or otherwise be teleportable  to `dest`, no limitations imposed on `fees`. 

  - for local reserve: transfer assets to sovereign account of destination chain and forward a notification XCM to `dest` to mint and deposit reserve-based assets to  `beneficiary`. 

  - for destination reserve: burn local assets and forward a notification to `dest` chain to withdraw the reserve assets from this chain's sovereign account and deposit them  to `beneficiary`. 

  - for remote reserve: burn local assets, forward XCM to reserve chain to move reserves from this chain's SA to `dest` chain's SA, and forward another XCM to `dest` to mint  and deposit reserve-based assets to `beneficiary`. 

  - for teleports: burn local assets and forward XCM to `dest` chain to mint/teleport assets and deposit them to `beneficiary`. 

   - `origin`: Must be capable of withdrawing the `assets` and executing XCM. 

  - `dest`: Destination context for the assets. Will typically be `X2(Parent, Parachain(..))` to send from parachain to parachain, or `X1(Parachain(..))` to send  from relay to parachain. 

  - `beneficiary`: A beneficiary location for the assets in the context of `dest`. Will generally be an `AccountId32` value.

### transferAssetsUsingTypeAndThen(dest: `XcmVersionedLocation`, assets: `XcmVersionedAssets`, assets_transfer_type: `StagingXcmExecutorAssetTransferTransferType`, remote_fees_id: `XcmVersionedAssetId`, fees_transfer_type: `StagingXcmExecutorAssetTransferTransferType`, custom_xcm_on_dest: `XcmVersionedXcm`, weight_limit: `XcmV3WeightLimit`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.xcmPallet.transferAssetsUsingTypeAndThen`
- **summary**:    Transfer assets from the local chain to the destination chain using explicit transfer  types for assets and fees. 

   `assets` must have same reserve location or may be teleportable to `dest`. Caller must  provide the `assets_transfer_type` to be used for `assets`: 

  - `TransferType::LocalReserve`: transfer assets to sovereign account of destination chain and forward a notification XCM to `dest` to mint and deposit reserve-based  assets to `beneficiary`. 

  - `TransferType::DestinationReserve`: burn local assets and forward a notification to `dest` chain to withdraw the reserve assets from this chain's sovereign account and  deposit them to `beneficiary`. 

  - `TransferType::RemoteReserve(reserve)`: burn local assets, forward XCM to `reserve` chain to move reserves from this chain's SA to `dest` chain's SA, and forward another  XCM to `dest` to mint and deposit reserve-based assets to `beneficiary`. Typically  the remote `reserve` is Asset Hub. 

  - `TransferType::Teleport`: burn local assets and forward XCM to `dest` chain to mint/teleport assets and deposit them to `beneficiary`. 

   On the destination chain, as well as any intermediary hops, `BuyExecution` is used to  buy execution using transferred `assets` identified by `remote_fees_id`.  Make sure enough of the specified `remote_fees_id` asset is included in the given list  of `assets`. `remote_fees_id` should be enough to pay for `weight_limit`. If more weight  is needed than `weight_limit`, then the operation will fail and the sent assets may be  at risk. 

   `remote_fees_id` may use different transfer type than rest of `assets` and can be  specified through `fees_transfer_type`. 

   The caller needs to specify what should happen to the transferred assets once they reach  the `dest` chain. This is done through the `custom_xcm_on_dest` parameter, which  contains the instructions to execute on `dest` as a final step.  This is usually as simple as:  `Xcm(vec![DepositAsset { assets: Wild(AllCounted(assets.len())), beneficiary }])`,  but could be something more exotic like sending the `assets` even further. 

   - `origin`: Must be capable of withdrawing the `assets` and executing XCM. 

  - `dest`: Destination context for the assets. Will typically be `[Parent, Parachain(..)]` to send from parachain to parachain, or `[Parachain(..)]` to send from  relay to parachain, or `(parents: 2, (GlobalConsensus(..), ..))` to send from  parachain across a bridge to another ecosystem destination. 

  - `assets`: The assets to be withdrawn. This should include the assets used to pay the fee on the `dest` (and possibly reserve) chains. 

  - `assets_transfer_type`: The XCM `TransferType` used to transfer the `assets`.

  - `remote_fees_id`: One of the included `assets` to be used to pay fees.

  - `fees_transfer_type`: The XCM `TransferType` used to transfer the `fees` assets.

  - `custom_xcm_on_dest`: The XCM to be executed on `dest` chain as the last step of the transfer, which also determines what happens to the assets on the destination chain. 

  - `weight_limit`: The remote-side weight limit, if any, for the XCM fee purchase.
