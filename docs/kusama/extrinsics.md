## auctions
 
### bid(para: `Compact<u32>`, auction_index: `Compact<u32>`, first_slot: `Compact<u32>`, last_slot: `Compact<u32>`, amount: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.auctions.bid`
- **summary**:    Make a new bid from an account (including a parachain account) for deploying a new  parachain. 

   Multiple simultaneous bids from the same bidder are allowed only as long as all active  bids overlap each other (i.e. are mutually exclusive). Bids cannot be redacted. 

   - `sub` is the sub-bidder ID, allowing for multiple competing bids to be made by (and  funded by) the same account. 

  - `auction_index` is the index of the auction to bid on. Should just be the present value of `AuctionCounter`. 

  - `first_slot` is the first lease period index of the range to bid on. This is the absolute lease period index value, not an auction-specific offset. 

  - `last_slot` is the last lease period index of the range to bid on. This is the absolute lease period index value, not an auction-specific offset. 

  - `amount` is the amount to bid to be held as deposit for the parachain should the bid win. This amount is held throughout the range. 
 
### cancelAuction()
- **interface**: `api.tx.auctions.cancelAuction`
- **summary**:    Cancel an in-progress auction. 

   Can only be called by Root origin. 
 
### newAuction(duration: `Compact<u32>`, lease_period_index: `Compact<u32>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.auctions.newAuction`
- **summary**:    Create a new auction. 

   This can only happen when there isn't already an auction in progress and may only be  called by the root origin. Accepts the `duration` of this auction and the  `lease_period_index` of the initial lease period of the four that are to be auctioned. 

___


## babe
 
### planConfigChange(config: `SpConsensusBabeDigestsNextConfigDescriptor`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.babe.planConfigChange`
- **summary**:    Plan an epoch config change. The epoch config change is recorded and will be enacted on  the next call to `enact_epoch_change`. The config will be activated one epoch after.  Multiple calls to this method will replace any existing planned config change that had  not been enacted yet. 
 
### reportEquivocation(equivocation_proof: `SpConsensusSlotsEquivocationProof`, key_owner_proof: `SpSessionMembershipProof`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.babe.reportEquivocation`
- **summary**:    Report authority equivocation/misbehavior. This method will verify  the equivocation proof and validate the given key ownership proof  against the extracted offender. If both are valid, the offence will  be reported. 
 
### reportEquivocationUnsigned(equivocation_proof: `SpConsensusSlotsEquivocationProof`, key_owner_proof: `SpSessionMembershipProof`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.babe.reportEquivocationUnsigned`
- **summary**:    Report authority equivocation/misbehavior. This method will verify  the equivocation proof and validate the given key ownership proof  against the extracted offender. If both are valid, the offence will  be reported.  This extrinsic must be called unsigned and it is expected that only  block authors will call it (validated in `ValidateUnsigned`), as such  if the block author is defined it will be defined as the equivocation  reporter. 

___


## balances
 
### forceSetBalance(who: `MultiAddress`, new_free: `Compact<u128>`)

### forceUnreserve(who: `MultiAddress`, amount: `u128`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.forceUnreserve`
- **summary**:    Unreserve some balance from a user by force. 

   Can only be called by ROOT. 
 
### setBalanceDeprecated(who: `MultiAddress`, new_free: `Compact<u128>`, old_reserved: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.setBalanceDeprecated`
- **summary**:    Set the regular balance of a given account; it also takes a reserved balance but this  must be the same as the account's current reserved balance. 

   The dispatch origin for this call is `root`. 

   WARNING: This call is DEPRECATED! Use `force_set_balance` instead. 
 
### transfer(dest: `MultiAddress`, value: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.transfer`
- **summary**:    Alias for `transfer_allow_death`, provided only for name-wise compatibility. 

   WARNING: DEPRECATED! Will be released in approximately 3 months. 
 
### transferAll(dest: `MultiAddress`, keep_alive: `bool`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.transferAll`
- **summary**:    Transfer the entire transferable balance from the caller account. 

   NOTE: This function only attempts to transfer _transferable_ balances. This means that  any locked, reserved, or existential deposits (when `keep_alive` is `true`), will not be  transferred by this function. To ensure that this function results in a killed account,  you might need to prepare the account by removing any reference counters, storage  deposits, etc... 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be Signed. 

   - `dest`: The recipient of the transfer. 

  - `keep_alive`: A boolean to determine if the `transfer_all` operation should send all of the funds the account has, causing the sender account to be killed (false), or  transfer everything except at least the existential deposit, which will guarantee to  keep the sender account alive (true). 
 
### transferAllowDeath(dest: `MultiAddress`, value: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.transferAllowDeath`
- **summary**:    Transfer some liquid free balance to another account. 

   `transfer_allow_death` will set the `FreeBalance` of the sender and receiver.  If the sender's account is below the existential deposit as a result  of the transfer, the account will be reaped. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be `Signed` by the transactor. 
 
### transferKeepAlive(dest: `MultiAddress`, value: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.transferKeepAlive`
- **summary**:    Same as the [`transfer_allow_death`] call, but with a check that the transfer will not  kill the origin account. 

   99% of the time you want [`transfer_allow_death`] instead. 

   [`transfer_allow_death`]: struct.Pallet.html#method.transfer 
 
### upgradeAccounts(who: `Vec<AccountId32>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.upgradeAccounts`
- **summary**:    Upgrade a specified account. 

   - `origin`: Must be `Signed`. 

  - `who`: The account to be upgraded.

   This will waive the transaction fee if at least all but 10% of the accounts needed to  be upgraded. (We let some not have to be upgraded just in order to allow for the  possibililty of churn).

   This function can only be called by the `RejectOrigin` a signed origin. 

   If this function is called by the `RejectOrigin`, we assume that the curator is  malicious or inactive. As a result, we will slash the curator when possible. 

   If the origin is the curator, we take this as a sign they are unable to do their job and  they willingly give up. We could slash them, but for now we allow them to recover their  deposit and exit without issue. (We may want to change this if it is abused.) 

   Finally, the origin can be anyone if and only if the curator is "inactive". This allows  anyone in the community to call out that a curator is not doing their due diligence, and  we should pick a new curator. In this case the curator should also be slashed. 

   #### Complexity 

  - O(1).

   If this function is called by the `RejectOrigin` or the  parent bounty curator, we assume that the child-bounty curator is  malicious or inactive. As a result, child-bounty curator deposit is  slashed. 

   If the origin is the child-bounty curator, we take this as a sign  that they are unable to do their job, and are willingly giving up.  We could slash the deposit, but for now we allow them to unreserve  their deposit and exit without issue. (We may want to change this if  it is abused.) 

   Finally, the origin can be anyone iff the child-bounty curator is  "inactive". Expiry update due of parent bounty is used to estimate  inactive state of child-bounty curator. 

   This allows anyone in the community to call out that a child-bounty  curator is not doing their due diligence, and we should pick a new  one. In this case the child-bounty curator deposit is slashed. 

   State of child-bounty is moved to Added state on successful call  completion.

- **summary**:    Delegate the voting power (with some given conviction) of the sending account for a  particular class of polls. 

   The balance delegated is locked for as long as it's delegated, and thereafter for the  time appropriate for the conviction's lock period. 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be _Signed_, and the signing account must either: 

  - be delegating already; or

  - have no voting activity (if there is, then it will need to be removed/consolidated through `reap_vote` or `unvote`). 

   - `to`: The account whose voting the `target` account's voting power will follow. 

  - `class`: The class of polls to delegate. To delegate multiple classes, multiple calls to this function are required. 

  - `conviction`: The conviction that will be attached to the delegated votes. When the account is undelegated, the funds will be locked for the corresponding period. 

  - `balance`: The amount of the account's balance to be used in delegating. This must not be more than the account's current balance. 

   Emits `Delegated`. 

   Weight: `O(R)` where R is the number of polls the voter delegating to has  voted on. Weight is initially charged as if maximum votes, but is refunded later. 
 
### removeOtherVote(target: `MultiAddress`, class: `u16`, index: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.convictionVoting.removeOtherVote`

  - the poll is ongoing, or

  - the poll has ended such that

  - the vote of the account was in opposition to the result; or

  - there was no conviction to the account's vote; or

  - the account made a split vote ...then the vote is removed cleanly and a following call to `unlock` may result in more  funds being available. 

   If, however, the poll has ended and: 

  - it finished corresponding to the vote of the account, and

  - the account made a standard vote with conviction, and

  - the lock period of the conviction is not over ...then the lock will be aggregated into the overall account's lock, which may involve 

  *overlocking* (where the two locks are combined into a single lock that is the maximum of both the amount locked and the time is it locked for). 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be _Signed_, and the signer must have a vote  registered for poll `index`. 

   - `index`: The index of poll of the vote to be removed. 

  - `class`: Optional parameter, if given it indicates the class of the poll. For polls which have finished or are cancelled, this must be `Some`.

   Tokens may be unlocked following once an amount of time consistent with the lock period  of the conviction with which the delegation was issued has passed. 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be _Signed_ and the signing account must be  currently delegating. 

   - `class`: The class of polls to remove the delegation from. 

   Emits `Undelegated`.

## electionProviderMultiPhase
 
### governanceFallback(maybe_max_voters: `Option<u32>`, maybe_max_targets: `Option<u32>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.electionProviderMultiPhase.governanceFallback`
- **summary**:    Trigger the governance fallback. 

   This can only be called when [`Phase::Emergency`] is enabled, as an alternative to  calling [`Call::set_emergency_election_result`]. 
 
### setEmergencyElectionResult(supports: `Vec<(AccountId32,SpNposElectionsSupport)>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.electionProviderMultiPhase.setEmergencyElectionResult`
- **summary**:    Set a solution in the queue, to be handed out to the client of this pallet in the next  call to `ElectionProvider::elect`. 

   This can only be set by `T::ForceOrigin`, and only when the phase is `Emergency`. 

   The solution is not checked for any feasibility and is assumed to be trustworthy, as any  feasibility check itself can in principle cause the election process to fail (due to  memory/weight constrains). 
 
### setMinimumUntrustedScore(maybe_next_score: `Option<SpNposElectionsElectionScore>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.electionProviderMultiPhase.setMinimumUntrustedScore`
- **summary**:    Set a new value for `MinimumUntrustedScore`. 

   Dispatch origin must be aligned with `T::ForceOrigin`. 

   This check can be turned off by setting the value to `None`. 
 
### submit(raw_solution: `PalletElectionProviderMultiPhaseRawSolution`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.electionProviderMultiPhase.submit`
- **summary**:    Submit a solution for the signed phase. 

   The dispatch origin fo this call must be __signed__. 

   The solution is potentially queued, based on the claimed score and processed at the end  of the signed phase. 

   A deposit is reserved and recorded for the solution. Based on the outcome, the solution  might be rewarded, slashed, or get all or a part of the deposit back. 
 
### submitUnsigned(raw_solution: `PalletElectionProviderMultiPhaseRawSolution`, witness: `PalletElectionProviderMultiPhaseSolutionOrSnapshotSize`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.electionProviderMultiPhase.submitUnsigned`
- **summary**:    Submit a solution for the unsigned phase. 

   The dispatch origin fo this call must be __none__. 

   This submission is checked on the fly. Moreover, this unsigned solution is only  validated when submitted to the pool from the **local** node. Effectively, this means  that only active validators can submit this transaction when authoring a block (similar  to an inherent). 

   To prevent any incorrect solution (and thus wasted time/weight), this transaction will  panic if the solution submitted by the validator is invalid in any way, effectively  putting their authoring reward at risk. 

   No deposit or reward is associated with this submission. 

___


## fastUnstake
 
### control(eras_to_check: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.fastUnstake.control`
- **summary**:    Control the operation of this pallet. 

   Dispatch origin must be signed by the [`Config::ControlOrigin`]. 
 
### deregister()
- **interface**: `api.tx.fastUnstake.deregister`
- **summary**:    Deregister oneself from the fast-unstake. 

   This is useful if one is registered, they are still waiting, and they change their mind. 

   Note that the associated stash is still fully unbonded and chilled as a consequence of  calling `register_fast_unstake`. This should probably be followed by a call to  `Staking::rebond`. 
 
### registerFastUnstake()
- **interface**: `api.tx.fastUnstake.registerFastUnstake`
- **summary**:    Register oneself for fast-unstake. 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be signed by the controller account, similar to  `staking::unbond`. 

   The stash associated with the origin must have no ongoing unlocking chunks. If  successful, this will fully unbond and chill the stash. Then, it will enqueue the stash  to be checked in further blocks. 

   If by the time this is called, the stash is actually eligible for fast-unstake, then  they are guaranteed to remain eligible, because the call will chill them as well. 

   If the check works, the entire staking data is removed, i.e. the stash is fully  unstaked. 

   If the check fails, the stash remains chilled and waiting for being unbonded as in with  the normal staking system, but they lose part of their unbonding chunks due to consuming  the chain's resources.

- **interface**: `api.tx.grandpa.noteStalled`
- **summary**:    Note that the current authority set of the GRANDPA finality gadget has stalled. 

   This will trigger a forced authority set change at the beginning of the next session, to  be enacted `delay` blocks after that. The `delay` should be high enough to safely assume  that the block signalling the forced change will not be re-orged e.g. 1000 blocks.  The block production rate (which may be slowed down because of finality lagging) should  be taken into account when choosing the `delay`. The GRANDPA voters based on the new  authority will start voting on top of `best_finalized_block_number` for new finalized  blocks. `best_finalized_block_number` should be the highest of the latest finalized  block of all validators of the new authority set.

- **summary**:    A bonded member can use this to claim their payout based on the rewards that the pool  has accumulated since their last claimed payout (OR since joining if this is their first  time claiming rewards). The payout will be transferred to the member's account. 

   The member will earn rewards pro rata based on the members stake vs the sum of the  members in the pools stake. Rewards do not "expire". 

   See `claim_payout_other` to caim rewards on bahalf of some `other` pool member. 
 
### claimPayoutOther(other: `AccountId32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.claimPayoutOther`
- **summary**:    `origin` can claim payouts on some pool member `other`'s behalf. 

   Pool member `other` must have a `PermissionlessAll` or `PermissionlessWithdraw` in order  for this call to be successful. 
 
### create(amount: `Compact<u128>`, root: `MultiAddress`, nominator: `MultiAddress`, bouncer: `MultiAddress`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.create`
- **summary**:    Create a new delegation pool. 

   #### Arguments 

   * `amount` - The amount of funds to delegate to the pool. This also acts of a sort of  deposit since the pools creator cannot fully unbond funds until the pool is being  destroyed. 

  * `index` - A disambiguation index for creating the account. Likely only useful when creating multiple pools in the same extrinsic. 

  * `root` - The account to set as [`PoolRoles::root`].

  * `nominator` - The account to set as the [`PoolRoles::nominator`].

  * `bouncer` - The account to set as the [`PoolRoles::bouncer`].

   #### Note 

   In addition to `amount`, the caller will transfer the existential deposit; so the caller  needs at have at least `amount + existential_deposit` transferrable. 
 
### createWithPoolId(amount: `Compact<u128>`, root: `MultiAddress`, nominator: `MultiAddress`, bouncer: `MultiAddress`, pool_id: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.createWithPoolId`

   same as `create` with the inclusion of 

  * `pool_id` - `A valid PoolId.
 
### join(amount: `Compact<u128>`, pool_id: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.join`
- **summary**:    Stake funds with a pool. The amount to bond is transferred from the member to the  pools account and immediately increases the pools bond. 

   #### Note 

   * An account can only be a member of a single pool. 

  * An account cannot join the same pool multiple times.

  * This call will *not* dust the member account, so the member must have at least `existential deposit + amount` in their account. 

  * Only a pool with [`PoolState::Open`] can be joined
 
### nominate(pool_id: `u32`, validators: `Vec<AccountId32>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.nominate`
- **summary**:    Nominate on behalf of the pool.

### poolWithdrawUnbonded(pool_id: `u32`, num_slashing_spans: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.poolWithdrawUnbonded`
- **summary**:    Call `withdraw_unbonded` for the pools account. This call can be made by any account. 

   This is useful if their are too many unlocking chunks to call `unbond`, and some  can be cleared by withdrawing. In the case there are too many unlocking chunks, the user  would probably see an error like `NoMoreChunks` emitted from the staking system when  they attempt to unbond. 
 
### setClaimPermission(permission: `PalletNominationPoolsClaimPermission`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setClaimPermission`
- **summary**:    Allows a pool member to set a claim permission to allow or disallow permissionless  bonding and withdrawing. 

   By default, this is `Permissioned`, which implies only the pool member themselves can  claim their pending rewards. If a pool member wishes so, they can set this to  `PermissionlessAll` to allow any account to claim their rewards and bond extra to the  pool. 

   #### Arguments 

   * `origin` - Member of a pool. 

  * `actor` - Account to claim reward. // improve this
 
### setCommission(pool_id: `u32`, new_commission: `Option<(Perbill,AccountId32)>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setCommission`
- **summary**:    Set the commission of a pool.  Both a commission percentage and a commission payee must be provided in the `current`  tuple. Where a `current` of `None` is provided, any current commission will be removed.

- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setCommissionMax`
- **summary**:    Set the maximum commission of a pool. 

   - Initial max can be set to any `Perbill`, and only smaller values thereafter. 

  - Current commission will be lowered in the event it is higher than a new max commission. 
 
### setConfigs(min_join_bond: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpU128`, min_create_bond: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpU128`, max_pools: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpU32`, max_members: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpU32`, max_members_per_pool: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpU32`, global_max_commission: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpPerbill`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setConfigs`
- **summary**:    Update configurations for the nomination pools. The origin for this call must be  Root. 

   #### Arguments 

   * `min_join_bond` - Set [`MinJoinBond`]. 

  * `min_create_bond` - Set [`MinCreateBond`].

  * `max_pools` - Set [`MaxPools`].

### setMetadata(pool_id: `u32`, metadata: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setMetadata`
- **summary**:    Set a new metadata for the pool. 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be signed by the bouncer, or the root role of the  pool. 
 
### setState(pool_id: `u32`, state: `PalletNominationPoolsPoolState`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.setState`
- **summary**:    Set a new state for the pool. 

   If a pool is already in the `Destroying` state, then under no condition can its state  change again. 

   The dispatch origin of this call must be either: 

   1. signed by the bouncer, or the root role of the pool,  2. if the pool conditions to be open are NOT met (as described by `ok_to_be_open`), and  then the state of the pool can be permissionlessly changed to `Destroying`. 
 
### unbond(member_account: `MultiAddress`, unbonding_points: `Compact<u128>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.unbond`
- **summary**:    Unbond up to `unbonding_points` of the `member_account`'s funds from the pool. It  implicitly collects the rewards one last time, since not doing so would mean some  rewards would be forfeited. 

   Under certain conditions, this call can be dispatched permissionlessly (i.e. by any  account). 

   #### Conditions for a permissionless dispatch. 

   * The pool is blocked and the caller is either the root or bouncer. This is refereed to  as a kick. 

  * The pool is destroying and the member is not the depositor.

  * The pool is destroying, the member is the depositor and no other members are in the pool. 

   #### Conditions for permissioned dispatch (i.e. the caller is also the  `member_account`): 

   * The caller is not the depositor. 

  * The caller is the depositor, the pool is destroying and no other members are in the pool. 

   #### Note 

   If there are too many unlocking chunks to unbond with the pool account,  [`Call::pool_withdraw_unbonded`] can be called to try and minimize unlocking chunks.  The [`StakingInterface::unbond`] will implicitly call [`Call::pool_withdraw_unbonded`]  to try to free chunks if necessary (ie. if unbound was called and no unlocking chunks  are available). However, it may not be possible to release the current unlocking chunks,  in which case, the result of this call will likely be the `NoMoreChunks` error from the  staking system. 
 
### updateRoles(pool_id: `u32`, new_root: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpAccountId32`, new_nominator: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpAccountId32`, new_bouncer: `PalletNominationPoolsConfigOpAccountId32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.updateRoles`
- **summary**:    Update the roles of the pool. 

   The root is the only entity that can change any of the roles, including itself,  excluding the depositor, who can never change. 

   It emits an event, notifying UIs of the role change. This event is quite relevant to  most pool members and they should be informed of changes to pool roles. 
 
### withdrawUnbonded(member_account: `MultiAddress`, num_slashing_spans: `u32`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.nominationPools.withdrawUnbonded`
- **summary**:    Withdraw unbonded funds from `member_account`. If no bonded funds can be unbonded, an  error is returned. 

   Under certain conditions, this call can be dispatched permissionlessly (i.e. by any  account). 

   #### Conditions for a permissionless dispatch 

   * The pool is in destroy mode and the target is not the depositor. 

  * The target is the depositor and they are the only member in the sub pools.

  * The pool is blocked and the caller is either the root or bouncer.

   #### Conditions for permissioned dispatch 

   * The caller is the target and they are not the depositor. 

   #### Note 

   If the target is the depositor, the pool will be destroyed.

### addTrustedValidationCode(validation_code: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.paras.addTrustedValidationCode`
- **summary**:    Adds the validation code to the storage. 

   The code will not be added if it is already present. Additionally, if PVF pre-checking  is running for that code, it will be instantly accepted. 

   Otherwise, the code will be added into the storage. Note that the code will be added  into storage with reference count 0. This is to account the fact that there are no users  for this code yet. The caller will have to make sure that this code eventually gets  used by some parachain or removed from the storage to avoid storage leaks. For the latter  prefer to use the `poke_unused_validation_code` dispatchable to raw storage manipulation. 

   This function is mainly meant to be used for upgrading parachains that do not follow  the go-ahead signal while the PVF pre-checking feature is enabled.

### pokeUnusedValidationCode(validation_code_hash: `H256`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.paras.pokeUnusedValidationCode`
- **summary**:    Remove the validation code from the storage iff the reference count is 0. 

   This is better than removing the storage directly, because it will not remove the code  that was suddenly got used by some parachain while this dispatchable was pending  dispatching.

- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.forceRegister`
- **summary**:    Force the registration of a Para Id on the relay chain. 

   This function must be called by a Root origin. 

   The deposit taken can be specified for this registration. Any `ParaId`  can be registered, including sub-1000 IDs which are System Parachains. 
 
### register(id: `u32`, genesis_head: `Bytes`, validation_code: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.register`
- **summary**:    Register head data and validation code for a reserved Para Id.

- **summary**:    Reserve a Para Id on the relay chain. 

   This function will reserve a new Para Id to be owned/managed by the origin account.  The origin account is able to register head data and validation code using `register` to create  a parathread. Using the Slots pallet, a parathread can then be upgraded to get a parachain slot. 

   #### Arguments 

  - `origin`: Must be called by a `Signed` origin. Becomes the manager/owner of the new para ID.

   #### Deposits/Fees  The origin must reserve a deposit of `ParaDeposit` for the registration. 

   #### Events  The `Reserved` event is emitted in case of success, which provides the ID reserved for use. 
 
### scheduleCodeUpgrade(para: `u32`, new_code: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.registrar.scheduleCodeUpgrade`

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the stash account. 

   Emits `Bonded`.  #### Complexity 

  - Independent of the arguments. Moderate complexity.

  - O(1).

  - Three extra DB entries.

   NOTE: Two of the storage writes (`Self::bonded`, `Self::payee`) are _never_ cleaned  unless the `origin` falls below _existential deposit_ and gets removed as dust.

- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.bondExtra`
- **summary**:    Add some extra amount that have appeared in the stash `free_balance` into the balance up  for staking. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the stash, not the controller. 

   Use this if there are additional funds in your stash account that you wish to bond.  Unlike [`bond`](Self::bond) or [`unbond`](Self::unbond) this function does not impose  any limitation on the amount that can be added. 

   Emits `Bonded`. 

   #### Complexity 

  - Independent of the arguments. Insignificant complexity.

  - O(1).
 
### cancelDeferredSlash(era: `u32`, slash_indices: `Vec<u32>`)

   Effects will be felt at the beginning of the next era. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_, but can be called by anyone. 

   If the caller is the same as the controller being targeted, then no further checks are  enforced, and this function behaves just like `chill`. 

   If the caller is different than the controller being targeted, the following conditions  must be met: 

   * `controller` must belong to a nominator who has become non-decodable, 

   Or: 

   * A `ChillThreshold` must be set and checked which defines how close to the max  nominators or validators we must reach before users can start chilling one-another. 

  * A `MaxNominatorCount` and `MaxValidatorCount` must be set which is used to determine how close we are to the threshold. 

  * A `MinNominatorBond` and `MinValidatorBond` must be set and checked, which determines if this is a person that should be chilled because they have not met the threshold  bond required. 

   This can be helpful if bond requirements are updated, and we need to remove old users  who do not satisfy these requirements. 
 
### forceApplyMinCommission(validator_stash: `AccountId32`)

  - Weight: O(1)
 
### forceNewEraAlways()
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.forceNewEraAlways`
- **summary**:    Force there to be a new era at the end of sessions indefinitely.

   #### Complexity 

  - No arguments.

  - Weight: O(1)
 
### forceUnstake(stash: `AccountId32`, num_slashing_spans: `u32`)

- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.reapStash`
- **summary**:    Remove all data structures concerning a staker/stash once it is at a state where it can  be considered `dust` in the staking system. The requirements are: 

   1. the `total_balance` of the stash is below existential deposit.  2. or, the `ledger.total` of the stash is below existential deposit. 

   The former can happen in cases like a slash; the latter when a fully unbonded account  is still receiving staking rewards in `RewardDestination::Staked`. 

   It can be called by anyone, as long as `stash` meets the above requirements. 

   Refunds the transaction fees upon successful execution.

- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.setStakingConfigs`
- **summary**:    Update the various staking configurations . 

   * `min_nominator_bond`: The minimum active bond needed to be a nominator. 

  * `min_validator_bond`: The minimum active bond needed to be a validator.

  * `max_nominator_count`: The max number of users who can be a nominator at once. When set to `None`, no limit is enforced. 

  * `max_validator_count`: The max number of users who can be a validator at once. When set to `None`, no limit is enforced. 

  * `chill_threshold`: The ratio of `max_nominator_count` or `max_validator_count` which should be filled in order for the `chill_other` transaction to work. 

  * `min_commission`: The minimum amount of commission that each validators must maintain. This is checked only upon calling `validate`. Existing validators are not affected. 

   RuntimeOrigin must be Root to call this function.
